# Xampp_Student_Records_Website

This project marked the commencement of my journey into full-stack web development. Subsequent assignments at NextBridge were bound by confidentiality agreements, limiting public disclosure. For this particular website, I utilized XAMPP as the development environment for PHP. XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package by Apache Friends, served not only as my development environment but also as the hosting service for the MySQL database.

The website features a straightforward form for entering student data. To manage and display this information, I implemented a table with pagination functionality, allowing users to view, edit, add, or delete student records seamlessly. Additionally, the table supports sorting, enhancing user interaction with the data. The development stack for this project comprised HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, enabling me to construct an interactive and user-friendly interface.
